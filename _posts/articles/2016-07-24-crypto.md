Cryptography deals with secrets. How to keep them, and how to choose whom to share them with. If you ever look at an ELI5 (explain like I'm five) article for a cryptography topic, say a particular cipher, you are bound to come across certain people. I guarantee that you will read about Alice and Bob, who always seem to have confidential conversations. And then there's Eve, a nosy friend who constantly wants to listen in on their classified communications.

Alice and Bob make sense, you think. A and B. Sure. But why Eve? Why not Claire or Casper or such? Well. I hope you're sitting down for this. Eve has a bad habit of listening in. Of..."eavesdropping". EVE-sdropping? Geddit, geddit, geddit?
