There comes a point when you begin to question the very purpose of it all. If you're unlucky, the moment is devastating, and you jump off the nearest bridge. If you're very unlucky, it isn't a moment at all, but a way of life. If you're very very unlucky, you simply accept that everything is meaningless and absurd, and you move on. This is the worst, because it means that you must now figure out what you are doing with your life, despite the fact that none of it will be of any consequence in the grand scheme of things.

Somehow, three years had already passed since I started college. To my chagrin, on quick self-evaluation, I realised that I had sampled a variety of topics but I couldn't claim to be an expert in any particular area at all. Breadth was all well and good, but a little depth now seemed to be in order.

I decided against a formal research internship for three reasons:
1. I didn't have any fellowship handed to me on a platter this time, and begging wasn't really my style.
2. What would I even beg for? I could insist that a certain topic excited me, but I had nothing to back that statement.
3. I was secretly looking forward to having some free time to myself to just curl up with a nice novel.

I chalked out a plan of action for the two-month summer, and convinced myself that I would stick to it. It involved waking up diligently at around noon, exercising not-at-all, doing a few online courses, reading some relevant academic literature, and playing around with some relevant toy programs.

It's been a month, and I am pleased to report that I now have significant familiarity with the topics of Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing. I watched lecture videos from Stanford courses. I mucked about with some TensorFlow programs. I slept in, and then some. I interrogated my dad when he mentioned that he'd once worked on some similar projects. I learnt volumes.
