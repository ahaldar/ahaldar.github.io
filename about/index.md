Hello! I'm Aparajita Haldar. You've found my (probably stale) technical blog!

At the time of writing (midway through 2020), I am a PhD student at the University of Warwick (Coventry, UK), supported by the Feuer International Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence. My research is in the field of artificial intelligence, with a fair smattering of natural language processing, knowledge representation, information retrieval, and graph theory in the mix. I do a fair bit of teaching and mentorship alongside my research commitments.

I graduated in 2018 from BITS Pilani Goa Campus (Goa, India), with a dual degree of B.E. Computer Science + MSc Mathematics, as well as a Minor in English Studies thrown in for good measure. Working towards my undergraduate thesis projects in my final year, I spent some wonderful months as an intern at Maxeler Technologies (London, UK) with the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence team, followed by an exciting stint as a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, US) in the Center for Language and Speech Processing.
