Hello, I'm Aparajita Haldar.

I'm currently an undergraduate student at BITS Pilani Goa Campus, India.
I'm pursuing a dual degree with BE Computer Science + MSc Mathematics, with a Minor English Studies thrown in for good measure.

At present, my research interests include (but are not limited to) Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Graph Theory, and Social Networks.
